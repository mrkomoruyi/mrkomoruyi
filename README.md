- 👋 Hi, I’m **Omoruyi E. Kelvin**.
- 👀 I’m interested in **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**.
  - I build ML models because I find them very interesting and fun to use. Plus, I believe they can help humanity in so much more ways than already utilized!
  - And I love experimenting and working with Data.
  - Computer Vision is frigging cool! 😂❤️
- 🌱 I’m currently:
  - improving my ML skills by working on small-scale, real-world projects.
  - learning NLP and its applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to:
  - undergo internship under an experienced ML engineer or Data Scientist to gain experience.
  - collaborate on projects that involve ML or Data Science for the experience and fun.
