- 👋 Hi, I’m **Omoruyi E. Kelvin**.
- 👀 I’m interested in **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**.
  - I build ML models because I believe they can help humanity so much more!
  - And I love experimenting and working with Data.
- 🌱 I’m currently:
  - improving my ML skills by working on small-scale, real-world projects.
  - refreshing and fine-tuning my web dev knowledge.
- 💞️ I’m looking to:
  - undergo internship under an experienced ML engineer or Data Scientist to gain experience.
  - collaborate on projects that involve ML or Data Science for the experience and fun of it.
